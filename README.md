# Khonsu for Rollemaa

A repository for 22th design, 5th WordPress theme for [Rollemaa.fi](https://www.rollemaa.fi), code name *Khonsu*.

Obviously, this theme is **not for the public to use**, since this is **my** website. Would feel awkward to see this in somewhere else. The theme is in here solely for backup purposes, and releasing in sake of open source, versioning and for you to see how I did this thing.

#### Etymology

Listened a lot of latest album by a progressive black metal band Khonsu, called [The Xun Protectorate](https://www.last.fm/music/Khonsu/The+Xun+Protectorate) during those three days. Also, Khonsu-god is like a "pathfinder". Me finding a path and staying up nights felt proper.

Khonsu (also Chonsu, Khensu, Khons, Chons or Khonshu) is the Ancient Egyptian god of the moon. His name means "traveller", and this may relate to the nightly travel of the moon across the sky. Along with Thoth he marked the **passage of time**. Khonsu was instrumental in the creation of new life in all living creatures. At Thebes he formed part of a family triad (the "Theban Triad") with Mut as his mother and Amun his father. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khonsu))

## History 

Rollemaa.fi is my first website ever, started originally in 1999. Since then I have resigned the site 22 times. From those designs five are WordPress theme and Khonsu is the fifth, started on *Wednesday, 26th of July*, during summer holiday, released on *Friday night, 28th of July*.

The website is in Finnish, since it's my personal blog and playground, and I'm Finnish. But the documentation should almost all cases be in English, in my opinion, if no specific reason to do otherwise. I am a huge fan of Medium.com and it can be seen in the layout.

### Features

- WordPress configuration is based on [dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) which is based on [bedrock by Roots](https://github.com/roots/bedrock). Not releasing the whole stack here, because the repository is about a gig and contains legacy code and stuff behind 10 years... (don't worry, been patching the security)
- Theme based on [air WordPress starter theme](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air)
- New logo! Old one looked like [this](https://www.rollemaa.fi/content/themes/newera/images/logo.png) (2014). New one looks like [this](https://www.rollemaa.fi/content/themes/khonsu/svg/logo.svg)
- No bootstrap or other bloated CSS
- CC0-photos and main video
- Dynamic footer (load on-demand on other pages than front page)
- No more nav burger! Horizontal mobile navigation
- SVG icons
- Accessible (I hope)
- Speed optimized
- Credentials, API keys and lisences are in .env file and ignored, naturally
- Circular -font in .gitignore

A full blog post can be read [here](https://www.rollemaa.fi/uusi-versio-julkaistu-rollemaan-kehityspolku-vuodesta-2014/) (in Finnish). Will continue developing the theme further.
